## Overview
This application accepts a location from a user and provides relevant information to the location (currently just an embedded map and static weather data). This application helps tourists and local people plan their time in the city more effectively through a collection of relevant information.

## Getting Started
+ First, go to the application's front end at https://codefellows.github.io/city_explorer/
+ Ensure your versions of node, NPM, and nodemon are up to date
+ Next, fork or clone this repository in a folder locally
+ In that folder, initialize NPM with npm init. Modify the package.json created by this to include the below dependencies
+ Then, install dependencies express, dotenv, and cors in the same repository. 
+ Set your environmental variable for PORT to 3000.
+ To test the application, type 'nodemon' in the console while in the same directory as server.js
+ Then enter http://localhost:3000 into the field showing on the front end.
+ Type in a city, and infomation will populate below.

## Architecture
This application is written in Javascript. We are reading data from APIs and sending this data to the front-end, which creates templates and displays data.
